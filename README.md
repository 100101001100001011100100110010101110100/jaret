<h4>Routers<h4>
<p>The router is the device that connects a LAN with the internet When you have two distinct networks or want to share a single internet connection to multiple computers we use a router. When we talk about computer network components, the other device that used to connect a LAN with an internet connection is called Router. When you have two distinct networks (LANs) or want to share a single internet connection to multiple computers, we use a Router.</p>
<h4>Switches</h4>

Switch is a telecommunication device grouped as one of computer network components. Switch is like a Hub but built in with advanced features. It uses physical device addresses in each incoming messages so that it can deliver the message to the right destination or port.</p>
<h4>Work stations</h4>
<p>work staions are personal computers attached to a local area network that in turn shares the resources of one or more large computers. A high-performance computer system that is basically designed for a single user and has advanced graphics capabilities, large storage capacity, and a powerful central processing unit.</p>

<h3>Three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h3>
  
- Web;
  The browsers you use on your computer or mobile devices are web clients. These are software designed to help end users access resources on the internet. The computers or devices that store these resources are called Web Servers.
- File
  Client Server is an architectural model, while a file server is a data organization method for storing user files centrally within a department or company.
- Mail service  
  email is delivered using a client/server architecture. An email message is created using a mail client program. This program then sends the message to a server. The server then forwards the message to the recipient's email server, where the message is then supplied to the recipient's email client.
